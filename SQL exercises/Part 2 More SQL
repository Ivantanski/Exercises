--1. For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table WHERE their age is over 50
people table schema
id
name
age
You should return all people fields where their age is over 50 and order by the age descending
Solution : 

SELECT * FROM people 
WHERE age > 50 
ORDER BY age DESC

--2. For this challenge you need to create a simple SUM statement that will sum all the ages.

people table schema
id
name
age
select table schema
age_sum (sum of ages) 

SOLUTION: 
SELECT SUM(age) AS age_sum FROM people;

--3. For this challenge you need to create a simple MIN / MAX statement that will return the Minimum and Maximum ages out of all the people.

people table schema
id
name
age
select table schema
age_min (minimum of ages)
age_max (maximum of ages)

SOLUTION : SELECT MIN(age) AS age_min, MAX(age) AS age_max FROM people;

--4.  Create a simple SELECT query to display student information of all ACTIVE students.

TABLE STRUCTURE:

students
Id (integer)	FirstName (text)	LastName (text)	IsActive (boolean)

Note:

IsActive (true = 1 or false = 0)
see specification: Datatypes In SQLite

SOLUTION : 
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE IsActive = 1;

--5.  For this challenge you need to create a simple GROUP BY statement, you want to group all the people by their age and count the people who have the same age.

people table schema
id
name
age
select table schema
age [group by]
people_count (people count)

SOLUTION : 
SELECT age, COUNT(*) AS people_count
FROM people 
GROUP BY age; 

--6. For this challenge you need to create a simple HAVING statement, you want to count how many people have the same age and return the groups with 10 or more people who have that age.

people table schema
id
name
age
return table schema
age
total_people  

SOLUTION : 

SELECT age, COUNT(*) AS total_people
FROM people 
GROUP BY age 
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10;

--5. What is the total population of ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania')

SELECT SUM(population) FROM world
    WHERE name IN ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania') 

--6. For each continent show the continent and number of countries. 
SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS Number_of_Countries
FROM world
GROUP BY Continent; 


--7. For each continent show the continent and number of countries with populations of at least 10 million

SELECT continent, COUNT(name) FROM world
    WHERE population >= 10000000
    GROUP BY continent

--8. List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million.

SELECT continent FROM world
    GROUP BY continent
    HAVING SUM(population) >= 100000000
